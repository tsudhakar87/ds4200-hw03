    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Thillainayaki Sudhakar, or Thillai for short.
        I am a second year Computer Science and Biology major at Northeastern University,
        and I am very interested in bioinformatics, web development, data analysis, and machine learning.
        Beyond the classes I've taken at university, some of the clubs I'm active in include 
        the NU Mars Rover Life Detection team, ViTAL's Healthcare Hackathon Organizing Team,
        NU UTSAV, NU WIT, NU BMES, and many others. I enjoy branching out and developing many new skills
        and meeting many new people.

        I'm from Lexington, MA but I mostly grew up in Colorado, so I'm not really a true Bostinian.
        However, I do enjoy exploring Boston with friends in my free time, and one of my favorite
        activities is trying new restaurants for ramen with my roommate and dear friend with whom
        I write a ramen blog with. We use the ramen blog not only as a means of keeping track of what ramen
        we've tried and our ratings of each, but also as a way to build our web development skills and
        attempt to create something from scratch using softwares and technologies we aren't quite familiar
        with. Usually, our process consists of trying something new, creating an iteration of our website,
        then starting all over again with a new technology in mind.
    </p>
