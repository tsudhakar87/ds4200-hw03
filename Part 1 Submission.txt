I stylized my website by adding a font family for all of my headers and paragraphs, 
and I also added a padding for everything to help keep things look a little
bit more organized. I also added a color for the top header to make it stand out.
To make the menu bar at the top, I had to add some extra stylizing for 
unordered lists so that it wouldn't show up with bullet points.
